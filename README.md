# Section 17: A Unit Addition Mod
v0.2.1

**Compatible with Second Wave and Legion.**

## Background

Most units in Section 17 were either rejected models, rejected unit roles, or rejected implementations from Second Wave. In many cases, they may be all of these.

In fact, even the name "Section 17" was a candidate name for Second Wave that was rejected.

In general, Section 17 is less serious of a mod than Second Wave is.

### Lore Background

Section 17 derives its name from a planet in old Galactic War lore, specifically:

> The most heavily guarded system of the Progenitor Coalition, Section 17 is where the majority of top secret Progenitor Coalition projects were developed. The system kept so secret that only a handful of people knew of its exact location. It remained a secret all through the Century War, as well as The Pro-Com War. It is rumored that it was the last system to be abandoned by the Progenitor Coalition during their Operation Kadota.

## Features

### Faction-Neutral

One of the main archetypes in Section 17 is that of the "Experimental", an alternative T3 unit class. Experimentals will be faction-neutral in the future.

All experimentals require a large amount of energy to maintain, with heavy passive energy draw alongside additional heavy energy draw while in use.

Compared to Titans, Experimentals require less metal to replace assuming that one already has the energy infrastructure required to field them.

Most experimentals tend to fulfill specific, but powerful, niches. There are some exceptions, like the Floater.
